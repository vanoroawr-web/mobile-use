# MobileUse: Open-Source GUI Agent for Android Automation📱

MobileUse is an open-source mobile GUI agent that controls real Android devices through ADB. It uses multimodal LLMs/VLMs, hierarchical reflection, proactive exploration, and a multi-agent framework to complete long-horizon mobile tasks across real apps. MobileUse supports WebUI usage, Python API usage, and benchmark evaluation on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab.

## 📊 Benchmark

## ✨ Key Features
- **Auto-operating the phone**: Automatically operate the UI to complete tasks based on user input descriptions.
- **Smart Element Recognition**: Automatically parses GUI layouts and identifies operational targets.
- **Complex Task Processing**: Supports decomposition of complex task and multi-step operations.

## 🚀 Quick Start
`mobile-use` requires [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) to control the phone, which necessitates the prior installation of the relevant tools and connecting the phone to the computer via USB.

### 1. Install SDK Platform-Tools
- Step 1. Download SDK Platform-Tools for Desktop, click [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads).
- Step 2. Unzip the downloaded file and add the platform-tools path to the environment variables.

    - Windows

        In Windows, you can add the `platform-tools` PATH to the ` Path` environment variable on the graphical interface (see [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10)) or through the command line as follows:
        ```
        setx PATH "%PATH%;D:\your\download\path\platform-tools"
        ```

    - Mac/Linux
        ```
        $ echo 'export PATH=/your/downloads/path/platform-tools:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
        $ source ~/.bashrc
        ```
- Step 3. Open the command line and enter `adb devices` (Windows: `adb.exe devices`) to verify adb is available or not.


### 2. Enable developer mode and open USB debugging on your phone
<img src="docs/assets/usb_debug_en.png" style="width:30%; height:auto;">

For HyperOS or MIUI, you need to turn on USB Debugging (Security Settings) at the same time.

### 3. Connect your computer and phone using a USB cable. And verify the adb is connected.
Run the `adb devices` (Windows: `adb.exe devices`) command on the command line terminal. If the device serial_no is listed, the connection is successful. The correct log is as follows:
```
List of devices attached
a22d0110        device
```

### 4: Install mobile-use
#### Option 1:  Install package directly
With pip (Python>=3.10, python=3.12 is recommended.):
```
pip install mobile-use
```
Note that the mobile-use installed using this method may not be the latest version.

#### Option 2:  Install from source code to apply the latest updates
```
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd mobile-use

# Install uv if you don't have it already
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
# We support using Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
uv venv .venv --python=3.12

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install mobile-use with all dependencies (pip >= 21.1)
uv pip install -e .
```


### 5. Launch the webui service
```
python -m mobile_use.webui
```

### 6. Usage
Once the service starts successfully, open the address http://127.0.0.1:7860 in your browser to access the WebUI page, as shown below:

![](docs/assets/webui.png)

Click VLM Configuration to set the Base URL and API Key of the multimodal large language model. It is recommended to use the multimodal large language model of Qwen2.5-VL series.

![alt text](docs/assets/vlm_configuration.png)

Input task descriptions in the input box at the lower left corner, click start to execute tasks.

### 7. Support Chinese characters (Optional)

If you want to input Chinese characters to your phone, for example, to let MobileUse execute a command like this: search for 
"咖啡" in the Meituan app, you need

- Step 1. Download ADBKeyBoard apk, click [here](https://github.com/senzhk/ADBKeyBoard).
- Step 2. Install ADBKeyBoard to your phone.
  ```
  adb install <path-to-ADBKeyboard.apk>
  ```

**⚠️ Special Reminder**: The actions are autonomously decided by the intelligent agent, which may pose uncontrollable operational risks. It is recommended that during the experience, you constantly monitor your phone's status. If you encounter any operational risks, promptly terminate the task or use a test phone for the experience to avoid issues caused by accidental operations.

## ⚙️ Advance

### Advance Settings
**📱 Mobile Settings**

The `Android ADB Server Host` and `Android ADB Server Port` allow you to specify the address and port of the android ADB service, which can be used for remote device connections or local android ADB services on non-default port. When multiple devices exist, you need to specify the `Device Serial No`. The `Reset to HOME` parameter indicates whether to return the phone to the home page before executing the task. If you continue the previous task, you need to cancel this option.

![alt text](docs/assets/mobile_settings.png)

**⚙️ Agent Settings**

The `Max Run Steps` parameter specifies the maximum number of iteration steps for the Agent. If the current task exceeds the maximum number of iteration steps, the task will be stopped. Therefore, you are advised to set a larger value for complex tasks with more operation steps. The `Maximum Latest Screenshot` is to control the number of latest screenshots that the Agent can see. Because pictures consume more tokens, when the task has more steps, Appropriately take a Screenshot of the latest `Maximum Latest Screenshot` and send it to VLM to generate the next operation accordingly. The `Maximum Action Retry` is to control the maximum number of retry times in one step if the action is failed to parsed. The greater the value, the higher the fault tolerance rate of the Agent, but the longer the processing time of the task.

**🔧 VLM Configuration**

Click `VLM Configuration` to specify the Base URL and API Key of the multimodal large language model, as well as the model name and temperature coefficient. It is recommended to use the multimodal large language model of Qwen2.5-VL series.

### Use agent with code
```python
import logging
import mobile_use
from mobile_use.utils.logger import setup_logger

setup_logger(name='mobile_use')
logger = logging.getLogger('mobile_use')

# Choose the Agent type and setup the config file
# All agents can be found in `mobile_use/agents` folder.
# Example configs can be found in `config` folder.
config_path = "config/mobileuse.yaml"
agent = mobile_use.Agent.from_params(dict(
      type="MultiAgent",
      config_path=config_path,
    ))

# Run a task
goal = "Close Wifi"

# Option 1: Directly use the `run` method to run the task
agent.set_max_steps(10)
agent.run(input_content = goal)

# Option 2: Only use the `step` method to custom your own running process.
agent.reset(goal)
for i in range(10):
    agent.step()
    agent.curr_step_idx += 1
    if agent.status == mobile_use.AgentStatus.FINISHED:
        break
```


### Benchmark evaluation
See [benchmark/android_world/README.md](benchmark/android_world/README.md) and [benchmark/android_lab/README.md](benchmark/android_lab/README.md).

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [x] Improve agent memory and reflection (summarize, compress.)
- [x] Provide multi-agent implementation 
- [x] Provide an evaluation process about AndroidWorld dynamic environment 
- [ ] Develop an APP that can be installed directly on the phone
